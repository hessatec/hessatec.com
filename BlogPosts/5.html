<p>In this blog post, the Hessatec team will explain the key features of Azure Functions through concrete examples.</p>

<h6 class="alt-font text-center">Introduction</h6>

<p>Azure Functions allow developers to deploy small pieces of code, known as “functions”, to the cloud. Like other Azure PaaS offerings, developers do not need to manage the underlying compute resources; they just publish their code, and it will be executed when a trigger is fired. Moreover, with the Consumption (Serverless) model, development teams are charged per-execution, an attractive proposition for modern applications.</p>

<p>As you design your application, consider the following benefits of Azure Functions:</p>

<ul class="list-style-02 margin-20px-bottom text-left">
    <li >
        <i class="feather icon-feather-arrow-right-circle text-large text-fast-blue position-relative margin-10px-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <span>Quick execution</span>
    </li>
    <li >
        <i class="feather icon-feather-arrow-right-circle text-large text-fast-blue position-relative margin-10px-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <span>Simple integration with other Azure resources through <em>bindings</em>. Our sample application leverages an Azure Blob Storage output binding</span>
    </li>

        <i class="feather icon-feather-arrow-right-circle text-large text-fast-blue position-relative margin-10px-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <span>Pay-per-use pricing model (though there are other ways to host Azure Functions)</span>
    </li>
    <li >
        <i class="feather icon-feather-arrow-right-circle text-large text-fast-blue position-relative margin-10px-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <span>Flexible development – there are multiple tools available to develop, test, and deploy Azure Functions. We will use the Azure Portal</span>
    </li>
    <li >
        <i class="feather icon-feather-arrow-right-circle text-large text-fast-blue position-relative margin-10px-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <span>Support for multiple platforms, including Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, and TypeScript</span>
    </li>
</ul>

<h6 class="alt-font text-center">Deploy the Sample Resources</h6>

<p>We provide an ARM template that mimics our deployment. Deploy the Azure Function App, and then consult the <em>run.csx</em> file and the <em>function.json</em> file in the <a href="https://github.com/hessatec/Demos/tree/main/02-functions-post/src"><strong>src/</strong></a> directory of the repository. <em>function.json</em> contains the trigger and binding details. <em>run.csx</em> contains the Function App Code, written in C# Script.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fhessatec%2FDemos%2Fmain%2F02-functions-post%2Farm%2Fazuredeploy.windows-function.json" target="_blank">

    </a>
</p>

<h6 class="alt-font text-center">Using Azure Functions</h6>

<p>A trigger causes a function to run, and Azure provides many triggers suited to a variety of business needs. <strong>Functions must have exactly one trigger.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Examples of Triggers:</strong></p>

<ul class="list-style-02 margin-20px-bottom text-left">
    <li >
        <i class="feather icon-feather-arrow-right-circle text-large text-fast-blue position-relative margin-10px-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <span><em>IoT Hub:</em> This trigger fires upon receiving an event from the Event Hub-compatible endpoint of Azure IoT Hub. For example, use the IoT Hub trigger to route data from IoT Hub to Azure Cosmos DB for querying. Note that Azure Stream Analytics can also do this</span>
    </li>
    <li >
        <i class="feather icon-feather-arrow-right-circle text-large text-fast-blue position-relative margin-10px-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <span><em>Blob Storage:</em> An example from the Microsoft documentation shows how an image uploaded to a particular container can be resized to two different sizes, which are stored in two separate Blob Storage containers. This function has one Blob Storage trigger (for the raw image) and two output bindings (for the resized images)</span>
    </li>
    <li >
        <i class="feather icon-feather-arrow-right-circle text-large text-fast-blue position-relative margin-10px-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <span><em>HTTP:</em> The trigger type we will demonstrate today. It is triggered by an HTTP request (of the appropriate method(s)) to the Function endpoint</span>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, Azure Functions support bindings. Bindings are declarative; that means that developers do not imperatively define how to connect to resources, but delegate that work to the Azure Functions runtime. In our example, by writing to an output <em>string</em> parameter titled <em>outputBlob</em>, the Azure Functions runtime creates a new blob in the specified container and writes the passed data to the new blob.</p>

<h6 class="alt-font text-center">Working with the Sample App</h6>

<p>Once you deploy the ARM template, navigate to the deployed Function App. Create a new function titled AnalyticsToAzureBlob with an HTTP Trigger. The goal of this very simple Function App is to write simulated website interaction analytics to a blob storage container, where the data can be aggregated, analyzed, and served using Microsoft technologies.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/function-app-post/new-function.png" alt="The new AnalyticsToAzureBlob Azure Function"></p>

<p>Select <strong>Code + Test.</strong> Copy the <em>function.json</em> and <em>run.csx</em> files from our repository. Then, select <strong>Test/Run.</strong></p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/function-app-post/test-run-azure-function.png" alt="Configuring Azure Function and selecting Test/Run"></p>

<p>In the <strong>Input</strong> tab, select <strong>POST</strong> as the HTTP method (1). Feel free to use either a function key or a host key. For <strong>userid</strong>, enter a sample username (2). For the request <strong>Body</strong>, populate the <em>timeSpentOnPage</em> and <em>numLinksClicked</em> keys; the request body is deserialized into the <em>AnalyticsJsonRequest</em> POCO (3). Select <strong>Run</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/function-app-post/test-http-request-to-function.png" alt="Preparing the HTTP POST request."></p>

<p>Wait for an HTTP response code of 200. Notice how the JSON response contains a <em>userid</em> key; that is the serialized <em>AnalyticsJsonResponse</em> object.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images//function-app-post/request-output.png" alt="200 request output from Azure Function App."></p>

<p>Navigate to the Storage Account deployed in the ARM template. Notice that there is a container called <em>useranalyticsstore</em>; it is specified in the output binding.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/function-app-post/blob-storage-container-list.png" alt="useranalyticsstore container from Azure Function output binding."></p>

<p>Navigate to the appropriate directory in the container (1). Select the JSON file (blob) written by the Azure Function (2). Select the <strong>Edit</strong> tab to view the contents of the JSON document.</p>

<p><img src="../assets/images/function-app-post/generated-blob.png" alt="Blob generated by Azure Function."></p>

<p>Congratulations. You have completed your first Azure Function App.</p>

<h6 class="alt-font text-center">Optional Tasks</h6>

<p>The Azure Function demonstrated in this post is quite simple. Now that you understand bindings and triggers, try the following:</p>

<ul class="list-style-02 margin-20px-bottom text-left">
    <li >
        <i class="feather icon-feather-arrow-right-circle text-large text-fast-blue position-relative margin-10px-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <span>Modify the AnalyticsToAzureBlob function to also write data to an Azure Cosmos DB collection. This requires configuring another output binding.</span>
    </li>
    <li >
        <i class="feather icon-feather-arrow-right-circle text-large text-fast-blue position-relative margin-10px-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <span>Create a new function titled ServeAnalytics. Using a Cosmos DB input binding, query the collection you created previously. Is it possible to build an entirely serverless website analytics solution?</span>
    </li>
</ul>

<h6 class="alt-font text-center">Conclusion</h6>

<p>In this post, we briefly introduced Azure Function Apps and discussed their business use cases. While Azure Function Apps serve stateless workloads well, use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview"><strong>Azure Durable Functions</strong></a> for stateful workloads. Durable Functions support multiple patterns for complex serverless applications.</p>

<p>Azure also offers <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-examples-and-scenarios"><strong>Logic Apps</strong></a> for customers. Logic Apps offer a powerful enterprise integration tool, connecting to solutions such as Office 365, SQL Server, and SAP. Like Function Apps, Logic Apps support serverless execution and many development environments. The Hessatec team plans to release more content about Logic Apps soon.</p>
