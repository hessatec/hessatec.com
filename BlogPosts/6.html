<h6 class="alt-font text-center">Primer on Integration Platforms</h1>
<p>Let us start with a quick primer so that we all have a common understanding of the terminology we use here.</p>
<p>An Integration Platform is software that integrates different applications and their services. It is a set of automated tools that integrate software applications that are deployed in different environments. Large businesses that run enterprise-level systems often use integration platforms to integrate applications and data that live on-premises and in both public and private clouds.</p>
<p>An Integration Platform hosts application servers, infrastructure, and data, and provisions integration tooling and middleware. These tools help developers build, test, deploy, and manage software that lives in the cloud.</p>
<p>Integration Platforms provide many capabilities, including the following:</p>

<p>Both Dell Boomi and MuleSoft Platforms are known to be widely used in private as well as public sector/governmental organizations across most domains, including manufacturing, healthcare, finance, retail, etc. Given the robustness of the platform and good customer service and support, both Boomi and MuleSoft have a similar rating of around 4.3 stars provided by 100s of users. You can read more about the published Gartner Group survey results <a href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/enterprise-integration-platform-as-a-service/compare/dell-boomi-vs-mulesoft"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>

<h6 class="alt-font text-center">Dell Boomi</h2>
<p>Dell Boomi AtomSphere is an on-demand, multi-tenant cloud integration platform for connecting cloud and on-premises applications and data. It enables customers to design cloud integration processes called Atoms and transfer data between cloud and on-premises applications. Boomi provides an integration platform as a service offering (iPaaS), which enables the connection of applications and data services. It is a low-code development platform. The platform provides API lifecycle management and event-driven architecture features for cloud integration. Boomi is well suited for integrating ERP systems such as NetSuite, SAP, and Salesforce. As a developer, here is the neat thing about Boomi: all the certifications provided by Boomi are free.

<h6 class="alt-font text-center">MuleSoft</h2>
<p>MuleSoft is a data integration platform built to connect a variety of data sources and applications and perform analytics and ETL processes. Mule, a runtime engine of Anypoint Platform, is a lightweight Java-based enterprise service bus (ESB) and integration platform that allows developers to connect applications easily and enables them to exchange data. It not only offers a solution that meets the requirements but goes beyond the function of a single-purpose integration tool to provide a complete integration platform that can be accessed through a single interface. MuleSoft offers a more flexible and scalable solution that provides the business functions they need in this digital age. If you wish to learn MuleSoft, you can learn it from U Course (self-study).

<p>To better understand both offerings, let us dig deeper into both these compelling offerings. To provide better readability, I am presenting the comparative analysis in a table form and pivoting around the most critical features.</p>

<h6 class="alt-font text-center">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Both Boomi and MuleSoft have great pedigrees; however, understand that MuleSoft has an edge in terms of modern architecture patter; out-of-box connectivity options; and pricing model. I also appreciate that MuleSoft’s future with Salesforce is well understood; Boomi’s recent acquisition by a private equity firm creates a certain amount of uncertainty and angst. After all, its Integration Platforms are ‘sticky’ and need Herculean efforts to undo!</p>
<p>To conclude, use this screenshot from a recent Gartner release that could sway your opinion.</p>
